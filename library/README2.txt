Absolutely, let's refine the explanation:

1. **Setup the Database Connection Info:**
   - First, we create a configuration file named `worldDB.properties` in the resources folder.
   - This file contains the necessary information to connect to our database, such as the host, port, database name, username, and password.

2. **Utilizing PropertiesProvider:**
   - We implement the `PropertiesProvider` class to read the connection info from the `worldDB.properties` file.
   - By leveraging a `static` block within `PropertiesProvider`, the connection data is loaded into memory when the class is initialized, even before the `main` method starts. This ensures that the data is readily available for use throughout the application's lifecycle.

3. **Database Interaction with WorldService:**
   - The `WorldService` class acts as the central component for all database interactions.
   - Upon instantiation, `WorldService` utilizes `PropertiesProvider` to access the database connection information, which is stored in the `worldDS` (MysqlDataSource) field.
   - Each method within `WorldService` utilizes the `worldDS` field to establish a connection to the database using `getConnection()` within a `try-catch` block.

4. **Integration with Menu Class:**
   - The `Menu` class serves as the user interface for interacting with the database through predefined actions.
   - When a user selects an action, such as adding a city, `Menu` calls the corresponding method in `WorldService`.
   - In Case 7 of the `Menu` class, we see an example where objects (e.g., connection-related objects) are passed to the `addCity` method. This demonstrates how method parameters can be used to provide necessary context or resources for database operations.

5. **myFileReader class is just so you can
By structuring our project in this way, we achieve a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage database interactions and user interface functionalities independently. This modular approach enhances readability, maintainability, and scalability of the application.
